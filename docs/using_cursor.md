## TODO
Use “Apply” and then “Command+Shift+S” (which is “Save All”) in Composor,
 or Command+S in Chat, then test your app. If you’re happy with the update, 
 click “Accept”; otherwise, click “Reject.”

I know it sounds obvious, but I was under the impression that I needed to 
Accept the update to see it in my app.

another tip: In Composer, you can click Command+R to reset the Composer and 
start fresh. There’s also a “Reset” icon in the UI for this
