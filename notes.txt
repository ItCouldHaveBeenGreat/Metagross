TODO
1. How can we initialize a simulator with state from another simulator? 
    a. How do we set HP, PP, etc? 


EVENTUALLY
1. Handle unknown state (e.g: random battles, VCG)
2. Does the monte carlo runner need to clone as often as it does?
3. What do we do with used up simulation instances?
4. Do we need a simulation instance pool that manages recycling? 



###
# PREDICTING THE STATE OF LIVE MATCHES
#################
1. Going off of the randombattle log, it seems like we only have access to our own state json. The other
    player's is entirely unknown. They do still take actions which we can read (|move|, |switch|,
    -status, |item|, |ability|) and use to construct a partial view of state.
2. We recieve a HP percentage when oponents get damaged. We know how powerful
    pokemon are, but not the damage rolls or the opposing pokemon's stats. This
    means we can infer a range for each of their stats. 

2. QUESTION: Can we use code from the client to collect/parse what's actually
            visible to the player?
3. 



Simulator command parser: lib/pokemon-showdown-0.11.9/sim/battle-stream.ts

>start {"formatid":"foo"}
>player p1 {"name":"Alice"}
>player p2 {"name":"Bob"}
>loadstate tests/test_data/test_parse_log_output.json


// Once both players have locked in, the round resolves
>p1 move 2
>p2 move 2
>p2 switch 3
